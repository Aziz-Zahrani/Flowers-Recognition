# Flowers-Recognition
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict flowers of 5 types using flower recogniton dataset on Kaggle.

There are 5 types of flowers that are predicted and trained on:

Daisy
Dandelion
Rose
Sunflower
Tulip
There are 4242 images in the original dataset.

I have trained Convolutional Neural Network written in Keras to predict the type of flower on the testing set. Also used ImageDataGenerator to augment the training set and avoid overfitting problem.

Finally the accuracy on the testing set is 85%.
